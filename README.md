# Mousedoom

This project demonstrates a simple Node.js server with a Vue.js single page application. Vue is included locally so the app works without external resources. The page records mouse movement and replays it as fading pointers.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the HTML with the embedded client: `npm run build`
3. Start the server: `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Testing

Run `npm test` to execute the basic client and server tests.
